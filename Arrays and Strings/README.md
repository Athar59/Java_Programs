- Array Size:
     Use the .length property to find the size of an array.

- Accessing Array Elements:
     Use indexes to access specific elements in an array.
     Change an element by assigning a new value to its index.

- Loops and Arrays:
     Use a for loop to go through each element of an array.
     Use a foreach loop (for-each) to access each element without using an index.

- Multidimensional Arrays:
     Declare a 2D array using int[][] arr = new int[rows][cols];.
     Access elements using arr[row][col].
     Use nested loops to process all elements.
  
- Useful Methods of the Arrays Class:
     Use Arrays.sort() to sort an array.
     Use Arrays.fill() to fill an array with a specific value.
     Use Arrays.equals() to compare two arrays.
     Use charAt(index) to get a character from a string.
     Use length() to find the length of a string.
     Use substring(start, end) to extract a part of a string.
     Use concat(str) to join two strings.
     Use replace(old, new) to replace characters in a string.

- Immutability of Strings:
     Strings in Java cannot be changed once created.
     Any modification creates a new string instead of changing the original one.

- String Comparison:
    Use == to check if two string variables refer to the same memory location.
    Use equals() to check if two strings have the same content.

- StringBuilder and StringBuffer:
    Use StringBuilder for fast string modifications (not thread-safe).
    Use StringBuffer for thread-safe string modifications.
    Use .append(), .insert(), and .replace() to modify strings efficiently.
