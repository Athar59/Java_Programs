- Java has 8 basic data types:
   • Whole numbers: byte, short, int, long
   • Decimal numbers: float, double
   • Single character: char
   • True/false values: boolean

- To use a variable, we must declare it by specifying its type and name. 
- Declaring a variable only creates it, but initializing means assigning a value to it.

- Variable scope defines where a variable can be used:
   • Local variables (inside a method, used only there).
   • Instance variables (inside a class, different for each object).
   • Class (static) variables (same for all objects of a class).

- Instance variables belong to objects, while static variables belong to the class and are shared.
- Reference variables can store null, meaning they have no value yet.
- Reference types store memory addresses and include objects and arrays.
- Casting and type conversion allow changing one type to another: automatic conversion (small to large) or   manual conversion (large to small).
- The final keyword makes a variable unchangeable (constant).
- Assignment operators like =, +=, -=, *= modify values.
- Autoboxing and unboxing convert between primitive types (int) and wrapper classes (Integer). 
- Primitive types are compared using ==, while objects (reference types) use .equals().
- Enumerated types (enum) define a set of fixed values (e.g., Days of the week). 
- An array is a collection of multiple values of the same type.
